Spatial analysis of Wi-Fi Bar in Rome Torpignattara neighborhood with OSM+R+leaflet+MapBox

This was an end-to-end data project which followed this scheme:

1. OSM editing based on survey to add nodes of cafe/bistrot/fast-food/etc. offering free Wi-Fi and the possibility to stay in the place to study/work with your own PC
2. OSM data curating in R
3. leaflet web map created in R+leaflet package
4. alternative webmap created with MapBox GL JS
5. Maps embedded in article here http://slow-data.com/wland

wland_main.R script is well documented so that you can folloe the workflow easily from it.
